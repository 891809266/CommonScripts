| git_push_to_new_repository.py | can be used to push github for the first time |                                          |
| execute_cmd.py                | can execute multiple commands or singal commands for the same interface | But when tested on Windows 10, the process will be stucked by some commands like "cmd" or "winver". It seems like a bug for the "subprocess" module. |
