- unzip.sh: Unzip  \*.tar.gz files in the root directory concurrently. Put this file into root dir, and it will recursively unzip all the tar.gz files and save at the same directory with the same name as tar.gz files.
  - i.e. ./root/myFile.tar.gz **(tar.gz file)** â†’  ./root/myFile **(all the unziped files will be saved to this directory)**
